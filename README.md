# BeheadTheDragon

This is what we need the game to have:

- Six or more players join the game.
- Five or more regular players start off with basic leather armor and a weapon (like BedWars).
- There is one player that is riding an Ender Dragon.
- The map by default will have crystals that should heal the dragon.
- The dragon has three abilities: wing fling, dragon breath, and block smashing.
- Wing fling flings nearby players up in the air like a regular Ender Dragon, dragon breath releases a ball of dragon breath like a normal Endre Dragon.
- Block smashing is where a player looks at an area with their crosshair, and that general area explodes (with the blocks flying upwards and landing somewhere).
- All of these powers are items in the dragon's hotbar. They should each have a cooldown, for you to decide.
- For every hit/damage point a player gets on the Ender Dragon, they get a "point". There will be a shop where you can upgrade your armor, buy tools, buy beds, pearls, etc with points.
- It's up to you to decide the pricing and any other items there (use your creative freedom).
- When either the dragon is dead or all players die (each regular player only has one life), the respective opponent team wins the game and are sent back to the lobby.
